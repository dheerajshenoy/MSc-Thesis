  abstract  = "Solar flares are often accompanied by filament/prominence
               eruptions, sometimes leading to coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
               By analogy, we expect that stellar flares are also associated
               with stellar CMEs whose properties are essential to know the
               impact on exoplanet habitability. Probable detections of stellar
               CMEs are still rare, but in this decade, there are several
               reports that (super-)flares on M/K-dwarfs and evolved stars
               sometimes show blue-shifted optical/UV/X-ray emissions lines,
               XUV/FUV dimming, and radio bursts. Some of them are interpreted
               as indirect evidence of stellar prominence eruptions/CMEs on
               cool stars. More recently, evidence of stellar filament
               eruption, probably leading to a CME, is reported even on a young
               solar-type star (G-dwarf) as a blue-shifted absorption of
               H$\alpha$ line associated with a superflare. Notably, the
               erupted masses for superflares are larger than those of the
               largest solar CMEs, indicating severe influence on exoplanet
               environments. The ratio of the kinetic energy of stellar CMEs to
               flare energy is significantly smaller than expected from the
               solar scaling relation and this discrepancy is still in debate.
               We will review the recent updates of stellar CME studies and
               discuss the future direction in this paper.",

  author    = "Gopalswamy, N",
  abstract  = "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are relatively a recently
               discovered phenomenon---in 1971, some 15 years into the Space
               Era. It took another two decades to realize that CMEs are the
               most important players in solar terrestrial relationship as the
               root cause of severe weather in Earth's space environment. CMEs
               are now counted among the major natural hazards because they
               cause large solar energetic particle (SEP) events and major
               geomagnetic storms, both of which pose danger to humans and
               their technology in space and ground. Geomagnetic storms
               discovered in the 1700s, solar flares discovered in the 1800s,
               and SEP events discovered in the 1900s are all now found to be
               closely related to CMEs via various physical processes occurring
               at various locations in and around CMEs, when they interact with
               the ambient medium. This article identifies a number of key
               developments that preceded the discovery of white-light CMEs
               suggesting that CMEs were waiting to be discovered. The last two
               decades witnessed an explosion of CME research following the
               launch of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory mission in
               1995, resulting in the establishment of a full picture of CMEs.",
