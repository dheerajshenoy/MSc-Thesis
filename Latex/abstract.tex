\section{Abstract}

Stellar Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are difficult to observe and analyse due to the lack of spatial resolution. Indirect methods have been devised to detect the signatures of CMEs on stars. One such method is Coronal Dimming. We have done Sun-as-a-star analysis of CMEs for various events using the data from SDO/AIA instrument and good correlations have been observed by Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis.
